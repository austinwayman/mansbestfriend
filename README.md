# MansBestFriend

This is a fullstack application that people can use to get information and form a community based around their pets. This was a group project built for the finals project of my boot camp. 

Theres a "Forum" section where you can add and read information from other users.

The "Care & Wellness" section uses Cheerio to scrape news articles from another website to show important information and articles based off the topic chosen. 

The "Lost Pets" section is a board that allows users to post lost animals so users can go and see if the animal they saw or found in their neighborhood is owned. This section needs the most work. For example, it needs the ability to add a users photo from their computer then upload it to our database, because currently it does not work. 

The "FAQ's" section shows popular questions pet owners have asks. This is hard-coded into our page. 

Lastly, the "VetFinder" page uses the Yelp API to find Vet's in your area by searching your Zip Code.
